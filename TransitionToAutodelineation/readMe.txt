The twins 1st order study and jack's study convinced Jason and myself that the StreamStats autodelineation tool is in fact a better than a human in most cases.
Going forward, all delineation will take place on StreamStats.
This means all existing watersheds (Order 2-5+) need to be rerun by interns.
We will use the watersheds delineated by Jack (~100 sites, range of stream orders across bioregions) as QA for future watersheds delineated.
